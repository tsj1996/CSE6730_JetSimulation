# Jet Engine Flow Simulation

- CSE6730 Project (Fall 2023)
- Team24: Sijian Tan, Kaiqun Peng, Cheng Zhang



## Project Overview

```bash
This project conducts a simulation of supersonic flow through a 2D scramjet engine inlet, utilizing an adaptive, first-order finite-volume method implemented in Python. 
Emphasizing total pressure recovery calculation at the engine inlet’s end, the project also offers insightful visualizations of Mach and total pressure contours. 
The study aims to advance supersonic inlet aerodynamics and integrate computational science and engineering (CSE) to solve complex aerospace challenges.

```
## Platforms
```bash
SolidWorks: ​
    Creating the CAD file of the scramjet engine geometry.​

Gridpro: ​
    Converting the CAD file into a computational grid file is essential for the scramjet engine inlet CFD simulation.​

Python:​
    Writing and executing the code for CFD simulation of the flow around the scramjet engine inlet.​
    Post-processing and visualization of the CFD simulation results.​
